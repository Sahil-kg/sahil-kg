üöÄ About Me

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), most of my repositories and work remain private. My current engagements involve sensitive projects that require discretion, limiting what I can share publicly.

Coding

I am a passionate Full Stack Developer and Robotics enthusiast with expertise in a diverse range of technologies, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Data Science, and Blockchain. Currently, I'm working on the prestigious DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC), a project focused on developing human-supervised robotic technology for disaster-response operations. This challenge, part of the U.S. Department of Defense's strategic plan, emphasizes creating robots capable of performing complex tasks in hazardous and degraded environments. I dedicate more than 75 hours per week to this highly demanding and impactful project.
Key Highlights:

    üèÜ Multiple Blockchain Hackathon Wins: I've won several hackathons in the blockchain domain, where I developed innovative solutions that bridge the gap between decentralized technologies and real-world applications.
    üåç International Robotics Competitions: I've actively participated in numerous international robotics competitions, showcasing my expertise and contributing to advancing robotics technology.
    üî≠ DARPA Robotics Challenge: Working as part of Team UAS-DTU, I have developed and implemented computer vision and deep learning models for UAVs and UGVs. My work focuses on human activity recognition, ODLC, visual servoing, audio classification, and health condition detection. Additionally, I created a full-stack GUI for real-time monitoring and synchronized control of multiple UAVs and UGVs, connected through an interop server for telemetry data, using Socket.IO for real-time operations.
